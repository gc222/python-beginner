# how do we know when a letter is guessed?
# we need to compare user input with the word
# instead of simply using "in" keyword to see if letter is in the word
# we use a set because duplicate letters are not recorded

# new letter compared to recorded letters
# if letter is new add to recorded letters and see if in word
# else reject letter

# set of recorded letters


# This body of code will print out the word
